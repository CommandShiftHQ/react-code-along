This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Clone down https://github.com/MCRcodes/react-bootstrap

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/react-bootstrap.git <your_project_name>
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd <your_project_name>
npm install
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the webserver needed to run your react application. Do not stop this process until you're done with your work.

### Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.

You should see a **Hello World** message.

### Change the rendered output by following step-by-step the history of commits on:

    https://github.com/MCRcodes/react-code-along/commits/master/src

from _Create and use App.jsx_ upwards (the last commit comes first on the list).

You can look at each step changes to the code by clicking the middle button on the right which has the commit hash, like `93063c3`. All files changed in a commit are listed with red highlights being deleted code and green highlights added code.

To see the output of any of `console.log` in the code you will need to have chrome dev tools open and tabbed to _console_
